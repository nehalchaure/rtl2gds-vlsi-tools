Hands-on journey through Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning, including tool setup, flow execution, and RTL2GDS experiments.

# Digital VLSI SoC Design – RTL2GDS Flow

This repository documents my journey through **Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning**, covering everything from **tool installation** to **RTL2GDS flow experiments** using **open-source EDA tools**.

---

## 📌 Objectives

* Install and configure all required open-source VLSI tools
* Document assignments and experiments from the VSD SFAL program
* Demonstrate the **end-to-end SoC design flow** from **RTL to GDSII**
* Provide a structured and reproducible setup for future learners

---

## 🛠️ Tools Installed

* **Yosys** – RTL synthesis
* **Icarus Verilog (iverilog)** – Verilog simulation
* **GTKWave** – Waveform visualization
* **Ngspice** – Circuit simulation
* **Magic VLSI** – Layout editing and DRC/LVS checks
* **OpenLANE** – Complete RTL2GDS flow
