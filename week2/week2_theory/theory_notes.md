# Week 2 â€” Fundamentals of SoC Design (Theory Notes)
## 1. Introduction: What is a System-on-Chip (SoC)?
A System-on-Chip (SoC) is an integrated circuit that brings together all essential components of a computing system onto a single chip. Typical SoCs combine:
- A processor (CPU or microcontroller)
- Memory blocks (SRAM, ROM, cache)
- Standard peripherals (UART, GPIO, timers, SPI, I2C, etc.)
- Specialized accelerators (DSP, AI engines, encryption blocks)
- Interconnect logic (buses or networks-on-chip)

The integration enables low power, high performance, compact size, and reduced cost compared to using multiple chips.
