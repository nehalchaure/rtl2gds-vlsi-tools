# Understanding SoC Design Fundamentals Through VSDBabySoC

This repository demonstrates a minimal **System-on-Chip (SoC)** design using **VSDBabySoC**, an educational platform for learning SoC concepts. It covers CPU design, clock generation, digital-to-analog conversion, and functional modeling.

## What is a System-on-Chip (SoC)?

A **System-on-Chip (SoC)** integrates all essential electronic components and subsystems of a computer or electronic system onto a single integrated circuit. Instead of assembling separate chips on a board, an SoC combines:

- Processing units (CPU, GPU, DSP)
- Memory subsystems
- Peripherals and interfaces
- Clock and power management  

### Advantages of SoC Integration

- **Size & Integration:** All components on one die reduce physical footprint dramatically.
- **Power Efficiency:** Shorter interconnects reduce energy consumption.
- **Performance:** Tighter coupling allows faster communication with lower latency.
- **Cost Reduction:** Fewer components simplify design and reduce manufacturing costs.
- **Reliability:** On-chip interconnects are more robust than board-level connections.

1. **Processing Units**
   - **CPU cores** for general-purpose computation.
   - **GPU** for graphics rendering and parallel workloads.
   - **DSP** for specialized signal processing.
